## 🚀 Project Overview

**TheatreCMS3** is a full-stack theatre content management system built using **C#, ASP.NET MVC**, and **Entity Framework**.  
I focused on building a tabbed UI to manage blog authors and their posts, styled with Bootstrap and enhanced by JavaScript for dynamic content toggling.  
This 2-week sprint resulted in a polished product delivered on time using Agile team collaboration.
