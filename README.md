## Project Overview

### Application
🚀 **TheatreCMS3** is a comprehensive theatre content management system built using **C#, ASP.NET MVC**, and **Entity Framework**.

My role was to develop *Blog Authors* that enables staff to manage said authors and their associated posts through a tab-based UI that displays Author Detail Cards and Blog Posts. I also worked on front-end UI/UX to create an enjoyable user-interface and experience through clean navigation and user-functionality. I'm proud of the work the team and I accomplished over the 2-week Sprint, providing deliverables on-schedule and to client satisfaction.

## Development Tools & AI Integration

The TheatreCMS3 project was developed in **Visual Studio** using a structured MVC architecture powered by **ASP.NET**, **Entity Framework**, and SQL Server integration.

To increase velocity, accuracy, and reduce time spent on boilerplate logic and syntax troubleshooting, I utilized **AI-assisted development tools**, including:

- 🤖 **GitHub Copilot**: Autocompleted controller methods, view logic, and model properties with context-aware suggestions. This greatly accelerated repetitive coding tasks while helping me stay focused on logic and structure.

- 🧠 **ChatGPT (aka the “Ninja”)**: Assisted in real-time problem-solving during debugging, migrations, view-model issues, and Markdown rendering challenges. Whenever I hit a wall, ChatGPT helped me break through with practical, immediate guidance.

> These tools didn’t replace critical thinking—they **augmented** it. I used them as a force multiplier to become a more agile, resourceful, and modern developer, capable of solving complex problems faster and with greater confidence.

## Git and Version Control

Version control handled using **Git** and hosted on **GitHub**:

- Feature branching  
- Pull Requests (PRs) for reviews  
- Merge and migration conflict resolution  
- `.gitignore` to exclude secrets and build files  

---

## Azure DevOps and Agile Process

Managed under a real Agile Scrum framework:

- Sprint Planning & Task Estimation  
- Daily Standups  
- Sprint Retrospectives  
- Azure Boards for tracking progress  

---

## SQL Server and Database Integration

Entity Framework with SQL Server used for backend:

- Code-First Migrations  
- SQL Server Explorer to inspect DB schema
