# üé≠ THEATRE CMS3 ‚Äî ASP.NET MVC Application

## üåü Project Overview

**TheatreCMS3** is a full-scale MVC web application developed in **C#** using the **ASP.NET Framework**. Built during an apprenticeship with **Prosper IT Consulting** as part of The Tech Academy‚Äôs developer bootcamp, this project simulates a **content management system for a fictional theatre company**.

This project was developed collaboratively using Agile/Scrum methodologies. As part of the team, I contributed through daily stand-ups, sprint planning, code retrospectives, and completing real-world user stories. The application serves as a powerful learning platform to understand enterprise-grade software architecture and modern development workflows.
