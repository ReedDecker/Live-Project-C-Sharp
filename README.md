## Project Overview

🚀 **TheatreCMS3** is a comprehensive theatre content management system built using **C#, ASP.NET MVC**, and **Entity Framework**.  
My role in this project was to manage the platform for *Blog Authors* that enables staff to manage said authors and their associated posts through a tab-based UI that displays Author Detail Cards and Blog Posts.  
I also worked on the UI/UX to create an enjoyable user interface and experience through clean navigation and user functionality.  
I'm proud of the work the team and I accomplished over the 2-week Sprint, providing deliverables on schedule and to client satisfaction.
